React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications where dynamic content needs to be rendered efficiently. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components that update in response to data changes without reloading the entire page. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize performance by only re-rendering parts of the interface that have changed, making it fast and efficient. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage complex UIs, and it can be used with other libraries or frameworks, such as Redux for state management. React is widely used in web development due to its flexibility, performance, and large community support. [React](https://react.dev/)
